# WinRegOps

The WinRegOps module provides a comprehensive set of PowerShell functions to interact with the Windows registry, offering a simplified interface for common operations such as reading, writing, and deleting registry keys and values. It acts as a wrapper around the Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey .NET class, extending its functionality for both local and remote registry operations.

The module is designed to handle tasks like retrieving specific registry values, exporting registry keys, managing subkeys, and removing keys with enhanced error handling. It allows for seamless interaction with the Windows registry across various environments and use cases, such as system configuration, profile management, and application settings.

This module can be used independently or as a dependency for higher-level management modules, offering flexibility and reliability in registry operations.

Key features:

- Open registry keys (local and remote).
- Query and retrieve registry values.
- Create, delete, and backup registry keys and subkeys.
- Built-in error handling for permission issues and remote access.
- Works with multiple registry hives (e.g., HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_CURRENT_USER).

Typical use cases include:
- Simplifying registry access in complex automation tasks.
- Providing a reliable registry management layer for other modules like ProfileManagement.
- Managing the lifecycle of registry keys during system configuration changes.
